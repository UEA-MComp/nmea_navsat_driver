# nmea_navsat_driver

ROS driver to parse NMEA strings and publish standard ROS NavSat message types. Does not require the GPSD daemon to be running.

## Notes

The ROS2 version of this package is still under development and this has some quirks, especially in regards to dependencies [this is a nice writeup](https://github.com/ros-drivers/nmea_navsat_driver/issues/160) about what you have to do.
